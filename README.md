# Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer

Welcome to the Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer project repository! Our goal is to develop and implement a sound synthesizer utilizing relays on the Nexys A7-50T FPGA board. Instead of generating audio signals directly, our system uses relays linked to Pmod connectors to produce audible sounds by controlling the on and off states of relay switches. Additionally, users can control basic functions like play, pause, and song navigation using push buttons. LEDs and a 7-segment display help visualize the melody.

## Theoretical Description

## Hardware Description of Demo Application
The project consists of the Nexys A7-50T board, Arduino Uno R3, 2 pieces of 2 relay modules, logic level converter, breadboard, and jumper cables. The Nexys board provides logic signals to the relay modules via Pmod Ports. Each Pmod Port group (JA, JB,JC, JD) has 2 GND, 2 VCC (3.3V), and 8 logic signals. However, the relay modules require 5V power and 5V logic signal. To provide 5V  power to relay modules, we use an Arduino. The Arduino provides 5V power to the relay modules by power ports. But we also need to change voltage level of logic signal. For this, we use a logic level converter ensures up to 3.3V logic signals are converted to 5V. Logic level converter module has two side. One side has 4 low logic signal (LV), 1 GND and 1 low voltage input. Other side includes 4 High logic signal output, 1GND and 1 high voltage input. But all the electronic components must connected to same ground line. So we connected to all the ground line together from Nexys, Arduino, Relay modules and Logic Level Converter. 
Brifely, we provide 4 Logic signals upgraded by LLC from Nexys FPGA board to 2 pieces 2 relay module and we provide the power for modules from Arduino. Here is the schematics of component connections:
