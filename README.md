# Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer

Welcome to the Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer project repository! This project aims to develop and implement a unique sound synthesizer utilizing relays on the Nexys A7 FPGA board. Instead of generating audio signals directly, the system employs relays connected to Pmod connectors to produce audible sounds by managing the activation and deactivation of relay switches. Users can compose and play basic melodies by programming the relay sequences.
