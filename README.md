"# Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer" 
Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer
Welcome to the Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer project repository! This project aims to develop and implement a sound synthesizer utilizing relays on the Nexys A7-50T FPGA board. At the project, Rather than generating audio signals directly, the system utilizes relays linked to Pmod connectors to produce audible sounds by controlling the on and off states of relay switches. Also the user can control the basic functions like play, pause, song navigaton by using push buttons. can compose and play basic melodies by programming the relay sequences.
