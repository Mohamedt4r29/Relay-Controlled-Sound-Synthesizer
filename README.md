Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer

Welcome to the Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer project repository! This project aims to develop and implement a sound synthesizer utilizing relays on the Nexys A7-50T FPGA board. At the project, Rather than generating audio signals directly, the system utilizes relays linked to Pmod connectors to produce audible sounds by controlling the on and off states of relay switches. Also the user can control the basic functions like play, pause, song navigaton by using push buttons. The LEDs and 7-segment display helps to visualization of the melody.

Theoretical description



Hardware description of demo application 

The project consist Nexys A7-50T board, Arduino Uno R3, 3 pieces 2 relay module, 2 pieces logic level converter, breadboard and jumper cables. 
As a main board of the project, Nexys provides the logic signals to the relay modules by 10 Pmod Ports. A 10 Pmod Port has 2 GND, 2 VCC (3V3) and 8 Logic signal. But the relay modules need 5V power and 5V logic signal. Because of that we also use an arduino and logic level converter. Arduino provides the 5V power the relay modules. Logic level converter provides to up 3.3V to 5V logic signal. For
