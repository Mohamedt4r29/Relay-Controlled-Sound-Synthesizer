# Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer

Welcome to the Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer project repository! Our goal is to develop and implement a sound synthesizer utilizing relays on the Nexys A7-50T FPGA board. Instead of generating audio signals directly, our system uses relays linked to Pmod connectors to produce audible sounds by controlling the on and off states of relay switches. Additionally, users can control basic functions like play, pause, and song navigation using push buttons. LEDs and a 7-segment display help visualize the melody.

## Theoretical Description

## Hardware Description of Demo Application
The project consists of the Nexys A7-50T board, Arduino Uno R3, 3 pieces of 2 relay modules, 2 pieces of logic level converters, breadboard, and jumper cables. The Nexys board provides logic signals to the relay modules via 10 Pmod Ports. Each 10 Pmod Port has 2 GND, 2 VCC (3V3), and 8 logic signals. However, the relay modules require 5V power and 5V logic signal. To address this, we also use an Arduino and logic level converters. The Arduino provides 5V power to the relay modules, while the logic level converter ensures up to 3.3V logic signals are converted to 5V.

## Software Description

## Component(s) Simulation

## VHDL Code Explanation
The VHDL code provided in this repository implements a rhythmic pattern generator for the sound synthesizer. It controls the toggling of outputs based on the states of the switches (SW). Each switch corresponds to a different rhythmic pattern or beat division. The code utilizes the clock signal (CLK100MHZ) to generate the beats and a push-button input (BTNC) to reset the beat states.

### Description of the VHDL Code:
- The code defines an entity named `PROJECT` with inputs for the clock signal (`CLK100MHZ`), switch inputs (`SW`), a push-button input (`BTNC`), and outputs for relay control (`JA`) and LED visualization (`LED`).
- Inside the architecture block, the code includes processes for beat generation and reset logic.
- The beat generation process increments counters (`period1` to `period4`) based on the clock signal and toggles the states of the beats (`state1` to `state4`) when the corresponding counter reaches a certain threshold.
- The reset logic process detects when the push-button is pressed (`BTNC = '0'`) and resets the beat states and counters.
- Outputs (`JA` and `LED`) are assigned the values of the beat states to control the relays and visualize the beats on LEDs.

This code forms the foundation for generating rhythmic patterns, which can be further developed to create more complex musical sequences or integrated into larger FPGA-based music synthesis projects.
