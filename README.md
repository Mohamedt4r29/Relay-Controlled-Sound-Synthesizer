# Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer

Welcome to the Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer project repository! Our aim is to develop and implement a sound synthesizer using relays on the Nexys A7-50T FPGA board. Instead of directly generating audio signals, our system utilizes relays connected to Pmod connectors to produce audible sounds by controlling the on and off states of relay switches. Additionally, users can control basic functions like play, pause, and song navigation using push buttons. LEDs and a 7-segment display help visualize the melody.

## Theoretical Description

## Hardware Description of Demo Application
The project consists of the Nexys A7-50T board, Arduino Uno R3, 2 pieces of 2 relay modules, a logic level converter, breadboard, and jumper cables. The Nexys board provides logic signals to the relay modules via Pmod Ports. Each Pmod Port group (JA, JB, JC, JD) has 2 GND, 2 VCC (3.3V), and 8 logic signals. However, the relay modules require 5V power and 5V logic signal. To provide 5V power to the relay modules, we use an Arduino. The Arduino supplies 5V power to the relay modules via power ports. However, we also need to change the voltage level of logic signals. For this, we use a logic level converter to ensure that up to 3.3V logic signals are converted to 5V. The logic level converter module has two sides: one side with 4 low logic signal (LV), 1 GND, and 1 low voltage input, and the other side includes 4 high logic signal outputs, 1 GND, and 1 high voltage input. However, all the electronic components must be connected to the same ground line. Therefore, we connect all the ground lines together from the Nexys board, Arduino, relay modules, and logic level converter. In summary, we provide 4 logic signals upgraded by the logic level converter from the Nexys FPGA board to 2 pieces of 2 relay modules, and we provide power for the modules from the Arduino. Here is the schematic of the component connections:

### VHDL Code Explanation

The VHDL code provided in this repository serves as the foundation for a Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer implemented on an FPGA board. Below is an overview of the functionality and structure of the VHDL code:

#### Entity Declaration:
The VHDL code begins with the declaration of the `SoundSynthesizer` entity. This entity defines the input and output ports required for the synthesizer. The input ports include:
- `CLK100MHZ`: Clock signal input.
- `BTNC`: Push-button input for resetting the beat states.
- `SW`: Four-bit vector representing the states of input switches.
The output ports include:
- `Relay1`, `Relay2`, `Relay3`, `Relay4`: Outputs controlling the relay switches.
- `LED`: Four-bit vector for visualizing beat states on LEDs.

#### Architecture:
Inside the `Behavioral` architecture block, processes handle beat generation and reset logic. The architecture follows a sequential logic design, triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal (`CLK100MHZ`).

#### Beat Generation Process:
The beat generation process is responsible for producing different rhythmic patterns based on the states of the input switches (`SW`). The code supports four different beats corresponding to each switch (`SW(0)` to `SW(3)`).

- **Initialization**: The code initializes variables to manage the durations and states of each beat period. It also sets the initial state of the switches and the reset signal.
- **Beat Generation**: For each switch, a corresponding beat pattern is generated based on its state. The duration of each beat period is controlled by incrementing counters (`period1` to `period4`) with each clock cycle. When a counter reaches its predefined threshold, the state of the corresponding beat is toggled.
- **Reset Logic**: The reset logic process detects when the push-button (`BTNC`) is pressed. When the button is pressed, the reset signal is activated, resetting all beat periods and states to their initial values.
- **Output Assignment**: The generated beat states are assigned to output signals for controlling the relay switches (`Relay1` to `Relay4`). Additionally, the beat states are visualized on LEDs to provide real-time feedback.

#### Description of the VHDL Code:
- The code follows a modular design, with clear separation of functionality into processes and entities, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- It leverages VHDL's concurrent and sequential constructs to efficiently manage the timing and control of beat generation.
- The code is well-commented, providing detailed explanations of each section's purpose and functionality.

This VHDL code forms the core of the Relay-Controlled Sound Synthesizer, providing the logic for generating rhythmic patterns and controlling relay switches based on user input. It serves as a flexible and customizable platform for creating various musical sequences and exploring different beats and rhythms.
